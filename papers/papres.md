## Como abordar a leitura de papers

**1. Assemble collections of resources that focus on the subject matter. Resources can come in the form of research papers, Medium articles, blog posts, videos, GitHub repository etc.**

A quick google search on the phrase “pose estimation” will provide you with top resources that contain information in regards to the subject matter. At this initial step, the aim is to collate all resources that are relevant, such as YouTube videos, implementation documentations and of course research papers. Ideally, at this stage, there is no limit to the number of resources you consider important, but be sure to create a shortlist of papers, videos and articles that are useful.

**2. In this next step, you will conduct a deep dive of any resource you deem relevant to the subject matter. It is crucial that there’s a method to track the understanding of each shortlisted resources. Andrew Ng, suggests a table of resource plotted against your understanding level that looks similar to the table below.**

It is advisable to ensure you go through at least 10–20% of the content of each paper you have added to the list; this will ensure that you have been exposed to enough of the introductory content within an identified resource and are able to gauge its relevancy accurately.

For the more relevant papers/resources identified, it is expected that you progress to a higher level of understanding. Eventually, you will have identified some appropriate resources with content that you understand fully.

You are probably asking yourself, “what number of papers/resource is sufficient”.

Well, I don’t have the answer, but Andrew does.

According to Andrew, an understanding of 5–20 papers will showcase a basic understanding within the subject matter, perhaps enough understanding to progress to implementation of techniques.

50–100 papers will primarily provide you with a very good understanding of the domain.

After going through the resources and extraction of vital information, your table might look something similar to what’s shown below.

**3. The third step is a quick tip from what I’ve observed works for me when trying to understand research papers. The third step is to take structured notes that summarises the key discoveries, findings and techniques within a paper, in your own words.**

LENDO UM ARTIGO

Reading for the purpose of understanding is not done through one pass of the contents within the paper. According to Andrew, reading a paper from the first word to the last word in one sitting might not be the best way to form an understanding.

Be prepared to go through a paper at least three times to have a good understanding of its content

4. In your first pass, start with reading the following sections within the paper: title, abstract and figures.
5. The second pass entails you reading the following sections: introduction, conclusion, another pass through figures and scan through the rest of the content.

The introduction and conclusion section of a paper contains clear and concise information on the content of the paper and a summary of any findings. The information presented in this section usually dismisses any supplementary information and only key information are included. This is beneficial to you as a reader as you get the vital information required to proceed to the other sections within the paper.
6. The third pass of the paper involves reading the whole sections within the paper but skipping any complicated maths or technique formulations that might be alien to you. During this pass, you can also skip any terms and terminologies that you do not understand or aren’t familiar.
7. Those conducting in-depth research into a domain can take a few more passes. These additional passes will mainly be focused on an understanding of the maths, techniques and unknown terminologies presented within the paper.

For those who are generally reading research papers for informational and engineering purposes, then in-depth research might be very time consuming, especially if you have 20 more papers to get through.

Questions To Ask Yourself

Andrew provides a set of questions that you should ask yourself as you read a paper. These questions generally will show you understand the critical information presented in a paper. I use the questions below as beacons to ensure I don’t stray from the aim of understanding vital information.

They are as follow:

    Describe what the authors of the paper aim to accomplish, or perhaps did achieve.
    If a new approach/technique/method was introduced in a paper, what are the key elements of the newly proposed approach?
    What content within the paper is useful to you?
    What other references do you want to follow?
